# RNA Folding Challenge

## overall idea
and sometimes you slide backwards bc life fucking sucks. so let’s say that each difficulty in your path to a william is represented by a single backward step, which we’ll call -1
if all of this is true, now the path to a william is a series of 0s, 1s, and -1s
like binary!
if you’re really cautious, your path may look something like 
`1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0`
if you have insane bitch disorder like me, your path may look like 
`0 16 16 0 0 -16 -16 -16 0 0 16 -16 0`
essentially, my bipolar disorder means i operate on hexadecimal when most people operate on binary. when I fall, I fall fucking hard, but when I get back up I overshoot

-- tune magnitude of sine wave, I guess

so my theory is that all processes on earth (and, like, in the universe) can be represented by ups and downs in a wave. some processes cycle really fast and some go slow. literally process is some kind of wave that bounces between zero and infinity, with a william (the most desirable outcome) in the middle 
these waves look like: light waves! sound waves! ocean waves! weird delta waves that your weird coworker asks you to listen to! bad vibes that a rancid person emits!
